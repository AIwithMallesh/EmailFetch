        "question": "m trying to create a new user in the system, but the user is not being created successfully. I followed the standard user creation process and filled in all required fields (username, email, role, and password).\nHowever, after submitting the form, I either receive an error message or no confirmation, and the user does not appear in the user list. I have verified that the username and email are unique and that I have sufficient permissions to create users.\nWhat could be the possible reasons for this issue, and how can I troubleshoot and resolve it?",
        "answer": "Thank you for reaching out regarding the issue with user creation. Please follow the steps below to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:\nVerify Permissions\nEnsure that your account has the required admin or user-management privileges to create new users.\nValidate User Input Details\nConfirm that all mandatory fields (username, email, role, password) are filled correctly and comply with system validation rules, such as password complexity and valid email format.\nCheck for Duplicate Records\nMake sure the username, email address, or phone number is not already associated with an existing (active or inactive) user in the system.\nReview Error Messages and Logs\nIf an error message appears, note it carefully. Additionally, check system or server logs for detailed error information related to user creation.\nConfirm Backend and Database Availability\nEnsure that all required backend services are running properly and that the database connection is active.\nTry an Alternate Creation Method\nIf available, attempt to create the user via another method (for example, admin panel vs API) to determine whether the issue is UI-related or backend-related.\nReview System Configuration\nCheck if any approval workflows, email verification settings, or environment configurations are preventing the user from being created or activated.\nAfter completing these steps, please retry creating the user and verify whether the user appears in the user list successfully.\nIf the issue persists, feel free to share the relevant error message or logs, and we will assist you further.\nBest regards,\nTelugu Mallesh",
